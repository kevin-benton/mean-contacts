MEAN Contacts

External Dependencies

I added MongoDB for OS X with homebrew following this guide: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/. I then added a data directory and started a Mongo instance with the data directory as the --dbpath option.

Running:

Should be as simple as entering the root of the directory and running `npm start` after starting a mongoDB instance.

Still TODO:
Change navbar to its own component
Add more data per contact (make backend respond differently to all get and detail get)
